# Cocktail Showcase Website

This repository contains a simple static website designed to showcase two
signature cocktails. The site is built with plain HTML and CSS so it works
anywhere — no special tooling required.

## Structure

- `index.html` – The main webpage with sections for each cocktail.
- `images/` – Folder containing the images used on the site. The current
  placeholders are artwork generated for demonstration; feel free to replace
  them with your own photos.
- `README.md` – This file, with usage and deployment instructions.

## Customization

To personalize the site:

1. Replace the images in the `images/` folder with photos of your own cocktails.
2. Open `index.html` in a text editor and update:
   - The `<em>[Your Name]</em>` placeholders with your name.
   - The headings and paragraphs in each cocktail section to describe your
     drinks.
3. Optionally adjust the CSS in the `<style>` block at the top of the page
   to change colors, fonts or layout.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Follow these steps to publish your cocktail showcase using GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account (e.g., `cocktail-showcase`).
2. Copy all files from this directory (`index.html`, `images/`, and `README.md`)
   into your new repository.
3. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch.
4. On GitHub, open the repository and navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**.
5. Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch (and the root folder if
   presented with a folder option), then click **Save**.
6. GitHub will build and host your site. After a few minutes, it will provide
   a URL like `https://<yourusername>.github.io/cocktail-showcase/` — visit
   that link to see your live portfolio.
